# File Organizer DevOps Project

A configurable Python script that automatically organizes files in a `watch_folder` by type (e.g., images to IMAGES folder). Containerized with Docker for portability and automated with GitHub Actions CI/CD for builds and tests. Built as a fresher project to showcase Python automation, containerization, and continuous integration.

## Features
- **Automation:** Sorts files by extension using pathlib and shutil.
- **Configurable:** Load categories/paths from `config.yaml`.
- **Observable:** Logs actions to console and `organizer.log`.
- **Portable:** Dockerized for consistent runs anywhere.
- **Automated:** CI pipeline builds Docker and tests with dummy files on every push.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+ (pathlib, logging, PyYAML)
- Docker
- GitHub Actions (YAML workflow)

## Setup & Local Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Rahul-V23/file-organizer-devops.git && cd file-organizer-devops`.
2. Build Docker image: `docker build -t file-organizer .`.
3. Create test folder: `mkdir watch_folder` and add sample files (e.g., .jpg, .pdf).
4. Run: `docker run -v ./watch_folder:/app/watch_folder file-organizer`.
- Expected: Files sorted into subfolders (IMAGES, DOCUMENTS, etc.); check logs.

## CI/CD Demo
- See the [Actions tab](https://github.com/Rahul-V23/file-organizer-devops/actions) for live auto-builds on pushes. Green badge = success!
- Tests: Pipeline creates dummy files, runs container, verifies sorting with `ls`.

## Lessons Learned
- Overcame Git sync hurdles (large files, conflicts) with .gitignore and web uploads.
- Docker caching tricked installsâ€”use `--no-cache` for clean builds.
- Full post-mortem in [this doc](link to your PDF if uploaded).

## Usage in Production
- Extend: Add cron for scheduled runs or Kubernetes for scaling.
- Contributions welcome!
